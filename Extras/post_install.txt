Manual Steps:

You're not done yet! Not everything could be automated. Here's what left:


!! Enable the Helvetica font

If you run a Debian based operating system, you'll have to disable the bitmap font block. From a terminal, run the following:

$ mv /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps-except-emoji.conf /etc/fonts/conf.d/70-no-bitmaps-except-emoji.conf.bak

- Open the XFCE settings manager > Appearance
- Click Fonts tab and select Helvetica Regular. Set to size 8.
- Enable anti-aliasing and set hinting to "Full."


!! Start Button

Open the XFCE settings manager > Panel > Items tab > Double click the Whisker / Application menu item in the item list; alternatively you can also access their settings menu by right clicking the icon from the panelbar and selecting "properties."

- In the Whisker / Application properties menu click the icon option (*This will appear as the icon badge on your start button that's currently in use.*)
- In the "Select An Icon" window, navigate to `/home/$USER/.themes/Chicago95/misc` (*with $USER being your username.*) You may have to click the pull-down menu from "Select icon from" and then select "Image Files" so that you can navigate to a custom icon on your filesystem. You may also have to enable the filechooser to display hidden files. (*Press Ctrl+h to toggle this setting.*)

`misc/` contains simple small icon badges in different sizes. You may have to experiment a little until you can find a size that fits correctly

....`misc/GTK2 start buttons/` contains start buttons that are used for the GTK2 version of the Whisker / Application Menu plugin.

....`misc/Legacy GTK3 start buttons/` contains start buttons that were used for an older GTK3 version of the Whisker / Application Menu plugin.

*Note: The smallest optimal panel row size for this theme is 24 pixels. If your panel is below that size, you will encounter icon scaling issues.*
