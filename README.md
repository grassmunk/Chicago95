I was unhappy with the various XFCE/GTK2/GTK3 Windows 95 based themes and decided to make one that was more consistent across the board for theming.

Included in this theme:

- New icons to complete the icon theme started with Classic95
- Edited Redmond XFWM theme to more accurately reflect Windows 95
- Edited Xfce-Redmond by dbbolton to be more accurate and include XFCE panels
- Created GTK-3.0 theme from scratch (based on Win 10 and Mate themes)
- Plymouth theme created from scratch
- An MS-DOS inspired theme for oh-my-zsh
- Partial support for HiDPI monitors

#### Requirements

GTK+ 3.22 or 3.24

Xfce 4.12 or 4.14

A Window compositor

(If your are using an older desktop that uses GTK3.18, you can use [this forked version of the theme.](https://github.com/EMH-Mark-I/Chicago95-Custom-XUbuntu-16.04-))
