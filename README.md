I was unhappy with the various XFCE/GTK2/GTK3 Windows 95 based themes and decided to make one that was more consistent across the board for theming.

Included in this theme:

- New icons to complete the icon theme started with Classic95
- Edited Redmond XFWM theme to more accurately reflect Windows 95
- Edited Xfce-Redmond by dbbolton to be more accurate and include XFCE panels
- Created GTK-3.0 theme from scratch (based on Win 10 and Mate themes)
- Plymouth theme created from scratch
- An MS-DOS inspired theme for oh-my-zsh

#### Requirements
GTK+ 3.22

Xfce 4.12
