# Chicago95

## XFCE / Xubuntu Windows 95 Total Conversion

I was unhappy with the various XFCE/GTK2/GTK3 Windows 95 based themes and decided to make one that was more consistent accross the board for theming.

Included in this theme:

- New icons to complete the icon theme started with Classic95
- Edited Redmond XFWM theme to more accurately reflect Windows 95
- Edited Xfce-Redmond by dbbolton to be more accurate and include XFCE panels
- Created GTK-3.0 theme from scratch (based on Win 10 and Mate themes)
- Plymouth theme created from scratch

I decided that the pop-overs were almost exactly as annoying/ugly as Clippy was in MS Office 97 so the buttons/coloring are matched to look exactly like that.

Background: Just set to whatever you like, for a more authentic look try setting Style to none and color to `#008080`.

### Fonts
Copy the folder `Fonts/vga_font` to `~/.fonts/truetype/` if the `.fonts/truetype` folder doesn't exist just create it before you copy the files.

### Where’s the classic Start Button?

If you want a classic style start button for the Whisker Menu or Application-Menu plugins instead of it defaulting to only an icon without the button borders, there are a few steps required to set this up.

Note: Your panel has to be 32px high if you wish to have the classic style Start button. If it’s any other size, the button won’t look correct. You’re more than welcomed to make your own Start button.
This is a work around because I’ve been unable to find a more sane means of making something that should be so simple to work...

1. Go to the install directory of the theme, i.e.`~/.themes/Chicago95/gtk-2.0/` or `/usr/share/themes/Chicago95/gtk-2.0/.`
2. You will see a file named `panel.rc` and another one named `panel.rc.alt`. Rename `panel.rc` to `panel.rc.bak`. Then rename `panel.rc.alt` to `panel.rc`.
3. Open the properties menu of either Whisker Menu or Application Menu and change the icon. The Start Button is located in the following directory: `~/.themes/Chicago95/gtk-2.0/panel` or `/usr/share/themes/Chicago95/gtk-2.0/panel.` Select the file name `start-button_windows` or `start-button_tux.`
4. The icon will appear crunched. Log out and log back in or run `xfce4-panel -r` to reset the panel interface. The icon should appear a regular size.

### Pulse Audio Icon Fix
Copy the `pulseaudio_fix.css` file from the `Extras\gtk-3.0 Override` directory into `/home/$USER/.config/gtk-3.0/` (This will fix the oversized pulse audio button and battery icon in the panel.)

Next, execute the following command as a regular user to import the pulseaudio fix:

`echo "@import url(\"pulseaudio_fix.css\");" >> /home/$USER/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css`

### Setting up the panel

1. Panel 1. Horizontal, 32px high ONLY, and 100% Length. Currently no proper vertical panel support so below or above only. (Make sure you set the background style to "None" so that it inherits the theme style.)
2. Application Menu; 
3. Separator (Handle Style); 
4. Custom Launcher, Custom Launcher, Custom Launcher, etc. (Try using 16px icons for the launchers.)
5. “Show Desktop” plugin; 
6. Separator (Handle Style); 
7. Window Buttons (Sorting Order: Timestamp and Window Grouping is Always. Uncheck “Show Handle” if it’s enabled.); 
8. Separator (Transparent with Expanding); 
9. Separator (Handle Style); 
10. Notification Area (19px max icon size); 
11. PulseAudio Plugin (Uncheck mark "Show Notifications when volume changes." it will conflict with XFCE notifiyd by making duplicate volume notifications); 
12. Separator (Transparent); 
13. Orage Panel Clock. ( In settings, enable check box “Show frame” and replace the text in “Line 1” with %I:%M %p.)

### Shadows
Disable shadows in compositing for an authentic appearance, or at the very least disable “show shadows under dock windows” to prevent dark shading from the panel bar overlapping onto maximized applications.

### Install tweaked icons

For the icon theme, I made a small adjustment that replaces the MS Windows logos with tux penguins. You can install this if you want. To install it, copy the `Chicago95-tux` directory into “/home/$USER/.icons.”

### Notification baloon theme
There is a notification baloon theme with Chicago95.
